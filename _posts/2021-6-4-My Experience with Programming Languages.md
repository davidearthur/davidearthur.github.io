Before taking ST 558, most of my programming experience was with SAS.  I had also learned a fair amount of R, but not in a systematic way, so there were large gaps in my understanding.  As I gain a stronger foundation in R, I find myself liking it more and more.  I appreciate the flexibility of R, and the wide availability of guides and tips for using it.  The vectorized function capability seems very powerful.  Since I have completed an entire course on SAS, versus just a few weeks of ST 558, there are still a number of things I know how to do in SAS but not in R, particularly related to producing aesthetically pleasing graphical reports.  I am curious how many of those  things can also be done in R, and the relative ease of doing them in R versus SAS.  With the RStudio environment and accessible documentation, I don't consider the basics of R particularly difficult to learn.
