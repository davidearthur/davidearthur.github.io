Since my first post about data science a couple of months ago, I feel like I've learned a lot about the field.  I'm much more comfortable coding in R now, though I also recognize better how much more I have to learn.  After working on several projects this semester, I see two areas that are more challenging and time consuming than I might have guessed before.  For one, while plenty of data is freely available, sorting through it to determine its quality and relevance to a particular question is no small task.  I intend in the future to spend less time searching for the "perfect" data set, and jump in a little more quickly to understanding and analyzing the "good enough" data set.

Second, debugging code and figuring out correct syntax sometimes took much longer than I expected.  In part that's because much of what I was doing was new to me.  I hope to spend less time on such issues in the future, but I'm sure I'll still have plenty of opportunities to appreciate the incredibly valuable online forums where users help each other solve problems, once I no longer have professors, TA's, and classmates to turn to.  I do hope to continue using R for data science projects in the future.  I am enjoying learning the language, and appreciate the huge array of packages available, as well as quality tutorials and vignettes.
